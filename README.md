# Sticker-generator
## TODO
### Phase I (Capturing character faces with different emotions)
- [ ] Dataset Collection(collection of video streams from cartoons/tv shows)
- [ ] Data preprocessing and cleaning (applying some image preprocessing techniques)
- [X] Face Detection(using MTCNNs for now)
- [ ] Face Recognition(Detecting character faces optional for now)
- [ ] Emotion Detection
### Phase II (Generating text for stickers)
